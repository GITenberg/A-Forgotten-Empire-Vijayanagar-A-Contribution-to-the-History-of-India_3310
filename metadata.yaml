description: The empire of Vijayanagar flourished between 1336 and 1565 and represented
  the grandest achievement of Brahmanism. The great Madhavacharya was probably its
  founder, his uterine brother Sayancharya was its greatest minister. Vijaynagar had
  its days of barbaric splendour, wealth and luxury reminding us of the declining
  glory of Rome, when Rajas and nobles kept many hundreds of women in their harems
  and many more to attend on them, when palaces were literally paved with gold and
  jewels, when temples and their priests revealed in the immensity of their ill-gotten
  wealth, in the dazzling magnificence of their festivals and the fleeting charms
  of dancing girls, and gorgeous monuments of architecture rose out of the sweat of
  slaves and prisoners of war.
